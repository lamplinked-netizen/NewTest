# ProtVista Starter Kit

A template repository for putting your own protein annotations on screen next to UniProt's — no build step, no npm, no JavaScript.

The page loads the viewer, `protvista-uniprot@5.0.0-beta.5`, from the jsDelivr CDN. You don't install anything.

## Use it

1. Click **Use this template** at the top of this page, and give your copy a name. Choose **Public** if you want to publish it with GitHub Pages: on a free GitHub account, Pages only works for public repositories.
2. Get the files onto your computer: **Code → Download ZIP**, then unpack it. (If you use Git, cloning works too.)
3. Serve the folder — see below.
4. Open <http://localhost:8000/> in your browser.
5. Edit `config.yaml`, save, reload the page.

**Why step 3 matters.** Browsers refuse to let a page opened straight from disk (a `file://` address) read other local files, so double-clicking `index.html` shows an orange box telling you to use a web server instead. The viewer cannot read its own config any other way.

There are two ways to do it. **Neither requires you to write any code.**

**Without a terminal — publish it.** In your new repository go to **Settings → Pages** and set the source to your default branch. GitHub serves the kit as a real website in a minute or two (the repository must be public on a free account), and you can edit `config.yaml` straight in the GitHub web editor and add your data files with **Add file → Upload files**. This is the simplest route if you have never used a terminal, and it is covered again under [Publish your viewer](#publish-your-viewer).

**With a terminal — run it locally.** You need Python 3, which provides a small built-in web server.

On **Windows**, open the unpacked folder in File Explorer, click the address bar, type `cmd` and press Enter. A Command Prompt opens in that folder. Run:

```bat
py -m http.server 8000 --bind 127.0.0.1
```

If Windows says `'py' is not recognized`, run this instead:

```bat
python -m http.server 8000 --bind 127.0.0.1
```

On **macOS or Linux**, open Terminal, `cd` into the unpacked folder, and run:

```sh
python3 -m http.server 8000 --bind 127.0.0.1
```

If that says *Python was not found*, Python isn't installed. If you use Anaconda, run the command from the **Anaconda Prompt** instead.

Then open <http://localhost:8000/> in your browser.

Leave that window open while you use the viewer; closing it stops the server. Without Python, either [install it from python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/), use the GitHub Pages route above, or use any other static file server you already have.

## What's in here

| Path | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `index.html` | The page. You will rarely need to touch it. |
| `config.yaml` | Your viewer: which protein, which tracks, which files. This is the file you edit. |
| `data/` | Your annotation files. Three samples ship here. |
| `recipes/` | Alternative configs to try — see [`recipes/README.md`](./recipes/README.md). |
| `.github/workflows/` | An automatic check on `config.yaml` — see below. |

### About the automatic check

Your copy comes with one GitHub Action that validates `config.yaml` against ProtVista's published schema every time you push. If you mistype a setting, the repository shows a red ✕ and GitHub emails you — that is the check telling you the config is wrong, not your repository being broken. Open the failed run to see which field it objected to.

It is a convenience, not a requirement. If you would rather not have it, delete the `.github/` folder; nothing else depends on it.

## Put your own data in

Drop a CSV or TSV file into `data/`, then point `config.yaml` at it. The file needs a header row with these columns:

| Column | Required | What it holds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | yes | The kind of feature, e.g. `DOMAIN`, `BINDING`, `REGION`, `MUTAGEN` |
| `start` | yes | First residue, counting from 1 |
| `end` | yes | Last residue. Same as `start` for a single-residue feature. |
| `description` | yes | Free text, shown in the tooltip |
| `score` | no | A number, if you have one |

So a minimal file looks like this:

```csv
type,start,end,description,score
DOMAIN,18,289,Extracellular domain (custom re-annotation),0.95
BINDING,132,140,Predicted heparin-binding site,0.87
```

and `config.yaml` points at it like this:

```yaml
data: ./data/my-features.csv
```

One thing that catches people out: paths in `data:` are resolved against **the page**, not against `config.yaml`. They start from the folder holding `index.html`. Keep your files under `data/` and the `./data/…` form always works.

`type` isn't free text once it's drawn — ProtVista recognises 45 type names
(UniProt feature types plus a few for peptides, epitopes and structure
coverage), each with its own default colour and shape, and renders anything
else as a black rectangle. See
[Feature type and shape vocabulary](https://ebi-webcomponents.github.io/protvista/type-and-shape-vocabulary)
for the full list.

The samples all use [`P05067`](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P05067) — amyloid precursor protein, 770 residues — so the coordinates in them make sense. Change `accession:` to your own protein and your own coordinates together.

For TSV, JSON and BED files, and for embedding data directly in the config, see [Load your own data](https://ebi-webcomponents.github.io/protvista/your-data).

## This kit needs internet access — unless you use `sequence:`

As shipped, yes, even with all your data in local files. The config is built around a UniProt accession, and the viewer fetches that protein's sequence before it draws anything, so there is always one network request.

If your protein isn't in UniProt — or the page must not reach the internet — replace `accession:` with `sequence:` and give the viewer the protein itself: a FASTA file in `data/` (`sequence: ./data/my-protein.fasta`) or the residues written into the config. The viewer then makes no request of its own; only your own files are loaded, from the same folder as the page. The component itself still comes from the CDN unless you host it too. See [Proteins outside UniProt](https://ebi-webcomponents.github.io/protvista/sequence-only).

## When something doesn't show up

| What you see | Usual cause |
| --- | --- |
| An orange box saying the viewer could not load | The component itself did not download. Check your connection, or whether your network blocks `cdn.jsdelivr.net`. |
| An orange box saying "Open this page through a web server" | You opened `index.html` directly instead of serving the folder. See step 3. |
| It still says "Loading the viewer…" | Usually a very old browser. Try a current Firefox, Chrome, Edge or Safari. |
| The viewer draws, but your track is empty | The path in `data:` does not resolve. Remember it starts from the folder holding `index.html`, not from `config.yaml`. |
| "No feature data available" | A wrong `accession:`, coordinates past the end of the protein, or a data file that could not be parsed. |
| Your track is empty and you edited the file on Windows | Windows hides file extensions by default, so Notepad may have saved `my-features.csv.txt`. In File Explorer turn on **View → File name extensions** and rename the file. |
| It works on your computer but not on GitHub Pages | Windows ignores the case of file names; GitHub Pages does not. `./data/Hotspots.csv` and `hotspots.csv` are different files once published, so make `data:` match the file name exactly. |
| Garbled text, or "missing required header column" for a file that has the columns | The file isn't UTF-8, or it uses semicolons. In Excel use **Save As → CSV UTF-8 (Comma delimited)**, not "Unicode Text" or plain "CSV". If your Excel still writes semicolons, export from Google Sheets or LibreOffice. See [Spreadsheet exports](https://ebi-webcomponents.github.io/protvista/your-data#spreadsheet-exports). |
| "row … is ragged" or "expected a number" | Usually a decimal comma: write `0.95`, not `0,95`. |
| You suspect your file is malformed | Open the browser's developer console (F12) — a file that fails to parse reports the reason there, naming the row and column. |

## Publish your viewer

In your repository's **Settings → Pages**, set the source to your default branch. On a free GitHub account the repository must be public. GitHub serves the kit as a website within a minute or two, and because it is all static files there is nothing else to configure.

Do check what is in `data/` before you do this. Publishing the site publishes those files too — anyone with the address can read them.

## Getting help

Questions, bugs, and suggestions go to the main [ProtVista repository](https://github.com/ebi-webcomponents/protvista/issues) — your copy of this template has no maintainers watching it.

The full documentation is at <https://ebi-webcomponents.github.io/protvista/>, and the [tutorial](https://ebi-webcomponents.github.io/protvista/tutorial) walks through the same ground as this kit in more detail.
